# Thank you ...

Thank you for hiring Cocode Designs to create your custom [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) theme.  We are grateful to be able to provide you with this bespoke content tailored for your needs.  This theme has been hand crafted by the team based on your needs.  You can see all of the settings that will affect parts of your theme here.

These settings are powered by the powerful [CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2) framework and is licensed under version 2 of the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).  It is open source and has been modified to provide you with the capabilities and functionality that you require in your theme.

However, our work isn't done yet. We're still on hand if you need support for your theme.  You can get in touch with us by emailing your Cocode Designer or visiting us at [https://www.cocode.co.uk/](https://www.cocode.co.uk/) and clicking on Support.
